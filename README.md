# Ex2_1
This program contains three methods for counting the number of lines in an array of text files.

## createTextFiles(int n, int seed, int bound)
This method creates a specified number of text files with random content.

Parameters

n: the number of files to create
seed: the seed for the random number generator
bound: the upper bound for the random numbers generated by the random number generator
Returns

an array of strings containing the names of the created files
Throws

FileNotFoundException: if the file cannot be created
UnsupportedEncodingException: if the encoding is not supported
## getNumOfLines(String[] fileNames)
This method returns the number of lines in the specified array of files.

Parameters

fileNames: an array of file names
Returns

the number of lines in the files
## getNumOfLinesThreads(String[] fileNames)
This method returns the number of lines in the specified array of files using separate threads for each file.

Parameters

fileNames: an array of file names
Returns

the number of lines in the files
Throws

InterruptedException: if any thread has interrupted the current thread
## getNumOfLinesThreadPool(String[] fileNames)
This method returns the number of lines in the specified array of files using a thread pool.

Parameters

fileNames: an array of file names
Returns

the number of lines in the files
Throws

ExecutionException: if the computation threw an exception
InterruptedException: if the current thread was interrupted while waiting
callCountLines
This is a Callable task that counts the number of lines in a file. It is used by the getNumOfLinesThreadPool method.![ex2_1]

## outcome&& what we learned
The performance of executing regular tasks can be improved by using threads. Threads allow for multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously, reducing the overall processing time. In the provided example, the elapsed time for the task "getNumOfLines()" was 3874 milliseconds. However, when using threads, the same task was completed in 416 milliseconds, as seen in the "getNumOfLinesThreads()" test. This represents a significant improvement in performance.
A thread pool takes this a step further by pre-instantiating a group of reusable threads, reducing the overhead associated with creating and destroying threads. The "getNumOfLinesThreadPool()" test in the provided example had an elapsed time of 541 milliseconds, which is faster than using regular thread, but slower than using a Thread pool. This demonstrates the added benefits of using a thread pool in terms of performance.

Elapsed time for getNumOfLines(): 3874 milliseconds

Elapsed time for getNumOfLinesThreads(): 416 milliseconds

Elapsed time for getNumOfLinesThreadPool(): 541 milliseconds
